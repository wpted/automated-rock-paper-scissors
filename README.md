## Rock Paper Scissors

Was originally trying to make a simple Rock Paper Scissors game, got bored. Eventually I decided to plot the results of
two bots playing and see if the possibilities of winning the game is really 50/50.

It sort of is.

### Setup

```
git clone https://github.com/wpted/automated-rock-paper-scissors.git

```
